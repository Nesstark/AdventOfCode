# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my repository for **[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)**! 🎅✨  

## 📜 About  
This is where I’ll be solving the daily Advent of Code puzzles throughout December. My goal is to work through the challenges while improving my skills in **Rust**.  

⚠️ Disclaimer: These solutions might not be the most elegant or efficient, but hopefully, they’ll get the job done! Feel free to take a look, learn from my mistakes, or share your suggestions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup  
- **Language:** Rust 🦀  
- **Editor:** VSCode
- **Version Control:** Git  

## 🏗️ Repository Structure  
Each day’s solution will have its own folder, structured like this:  
```
📂 dayXX/
   ├── input.txt   # Puzzle input
   ├── solution.rs # Rust code
   ├── README.md   # Explanation or notes (if needed)
```  

## 🚀 Running the Code  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nesstark/advent-of-code.git
   cd advent-of-code
   ```  
2. Navigate to the day’s folder:  
   ```bash
   cd day01
   ```  
3. Compile and run the solution:  
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
